# Quick Improvements Summary

## 🎯 TL;DR - Top 3 Most Important Changes

### 1. **Remove `max_steps=1`** 🔥🔥🔥
**Current**: Both models trained for only 1 step (essentially untrained!)
**Fix**: Set `max_steps=-1` or remove it entirely
**Impact**: This alone could give you 10-20x improvement

### 2. **Use More Data** 🔥🔥🔥
**Current**: Only using 2% of available data (every 50th sample)
**Fix**: Use 25-100% of data
**Impact**: Could improve scores by 100-300%

### 3. **Train for More Epochs** 🔥🔥
**Current**: 1 epoch for full fine-tuning, 3 for PEFT (but limited by max_steps=1)
**Fix**: 3-5 epochs for full fine-tuning, 5-10 for PEFT
**Impact**: Could improve scores by 50-100%

#### Phase 3 (Best - 8-12 hours):
- **Fine-tuned Model**: ROUGE-L = **0.40-0.50** (112-165% improvement)
- **PEFT Model**: ROUGE-L = **0.35-0.45** (120-183% improvement)

## 🔍 How to Verify Improvements

### During Training:
Look for these in the logs:
- Training loss should decrease consistently
- Evaluation loss should decrease
- Training should run for hundreds/thousands of steps (not just 1!)

### After Training:
```python
# Evaluate your improved model
scores, preds, refs = evaluate_model_comprehensive(
    improved_peft_model,  # or improved_finetuned_model
    tokenizer,
    generation_config_beam,
    num_samples=50,
    model_name="My Improved Model"
)

# Compare with original
print(f"Original PEFT ROUGE-L: 0.159")
print(f"Improved PEFT ROUGE-L: {scores['rougeL']:.3f}")
print(f"Improvement: {(scores['rougeL'] - 0.159) / 0.159 * 100:.1f}%")
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory Error:
```python
# Reduce batch size
per_device_train_batch_size=1  # instead of 2 or 4
gradient_accumulation_steps=16  # increase to maintain effective batch size
```

### Training Too Slow:
```python
# Use less data initially
improved_tokenized_datasets = tokenized_datasets_10pct  # 10% instead of 25%

# Or reduce epochs
num_train_epochs=3  # instead of 5
```

### Scores Not Improving:
- Make sure you removed `max_steps=1`
- Verify training ran for many steps (check logs)
- Try different LoRA configurations
- Use beam search for generation (not greedy/sampling)
- Evaluate on more samples (50-100)

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. ✅ **Read this summary** (you're doing it!)
2. ✅ **Open the notebook** and go to Section 4
3. ✅ **Run the PEFT training** (fastest way to see improvement)
4. ✅ **Evaluate and compare** results
5. ✅ **Try full fine-tuning** if PEFT results are good
6. ✅ **Experiment with 100% data** overnight for best results

## 💡 Key Insight

The **single biggest issue** with your current setup is `max_steps=1`. This means both your "fine-tuned" and "PEFT" models were essentially only trained for 1 gradient update - they're practically the same as the original model!

By simply removing this limit and training properly, you should see **dramatic improvements** (2-3x better ROUGE scores).

All the other optimizations (more data, better LoRA config, beam search, etc.) will stack on top of this foundation for even better results.

**Good luck with your training! 🚀**
